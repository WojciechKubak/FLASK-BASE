   - Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from the official Docker website: [Docker Installation](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```shell
   git clone <repository_name>
   ```
3. **Navigate to the Project's Root Directory**:
   ```shell
   cd <project_root_directory>
   ```
4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template.
5. **Build and Start Docker Containers**:
   - Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers for the application:
     ```shell
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```
6. **Apply Database Migrations**:
   - After the containers are up and running, apply the database migrations using Alembic. Replace `a7` with the actual name of your Flask container:
     ```shell
     docker exec -it <flask_container_name> alembic upgrade head
     ```
7. **Access the Application**:
   - Your application should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You can explore the API endpoints and use the Postman collection for testing and interacting with the application.
